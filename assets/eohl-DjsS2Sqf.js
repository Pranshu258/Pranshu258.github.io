Area F5 in monkeys (involved in gestures of grasping an object with either hands or mouth) and Premotor Area 6 in humans (involved in orofacial musculature control).

Thus, helping them to communicate and continue the flow of knowledge. However, inheritance is indeed subject to mutation and in the same way, learning is to subject to mistakes.

This involves actions and thoughts related to our everyday tasks, which must be selected and coordinated in a hierarchical manner so that the task is executed successfully. And in this process of selection and coordination of actions and thoughts syntax must play a very crucial part because whatever action we perform the brain processes it step by step similar to syntax.",e.jsx("br",{}),"It has been established that Broca’s Area (BA) in our brain has very important role in the processing of linguistic syntax. An experimental study was conducted by Clerget et al. to understand the role of BA in the execution of manual tasks.

The language also lacks recursion which is supposed to be a very important aspect of human language that differentiates it from the communication techniques of other species.",e.jsx("br",{}),"Also, after being in regular contact for 200 years with Brazilian people who speak Portuguese, Pirahã people still are monolingual. This is mainly attributed to the incompatibility of the two languages because of the cultural constraints. It has been shown, however, that the Pirahã people do not lack the cognitive capabilities to communicate without these constraints. There are many of them who were raised in urban Brazil and they speak Portuguese perfectly fine without any of those constraints. So, the features in the Pirahã language are largely due to the culture of the people and not their intelligence. Therefore, culture is indeed an important factor in the evolution of language.

Researchers have found a gene called FOXP2 [6] which plays a significant role in proper functioning of language faculty in humans.
